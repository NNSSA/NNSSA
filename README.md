### Hello there! 

I'm Nash - currently a research fellow at Johns Hopkins University. I work at the intersection of physics, data science, and machine learning, with an emphasis on building and applying numerical frameworks in cosmology and astrophysics. My personal website can be found [here](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1758386?ui-citation-summary=true](https://nnssa.github.io)https://nnssa.github.io).
